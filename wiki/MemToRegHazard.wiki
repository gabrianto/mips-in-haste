#summary How Memory to Register Hazard is handled

= Problem =

When register is to be loaded from memory the next 
commands depending on that register may start before the register is written back.

= Solution =

This is similar to Data Hazard that we already handling.
Actually WriteReg is going to be the correct register and RegWrite is 1
So the pipe already stalls until the register is read from memory
