How to both synchronize with the e2m/m2w and the synch-memory
= Introduction =

Since the machine is asynch, we need to wait till we have a valid e2m channel-data, then setup the mem addr/ctl, then wait for the read-data to return (negedge of NEXT clock) and then drive the result to m2w pipe.

Option 1:
- We could read the next e2m command before ocmpleting the above and save the information till the m-cycle completes. However this will effectivley create another pipeline stage here. COMPLICATED. Is this worth while?

Option 2:
do everything in series - which means we do not utilize the memory every cycle (1/2 clk rate at best)

** proposal: decide NOT to try & access memory at every clkc cycle but make do with once every 2 clks at best. Will check with Prof. Ginosar if this proposal is reasonable later on (& change and improve the stage as needed then)
