How to prevent the asynchronous order of the Write Back from reading an un-written RF
entry?

= Problem =

The problem is that we want to get write data and write it before we read.
    # But when the machine is empty we do not get data from the Write-Back.
    # When the machine stalls we still need to write the data in.

We need to make sure that if there was supposed to be a returning write-back the write happens before the read.

= Solution =

We can simply count how many data sets were sent down the pipe versus how many write back happened. If there were > 3 sent vs write back we need to wait for write-back.
Implementation is a simple number-of-outstanding counter
