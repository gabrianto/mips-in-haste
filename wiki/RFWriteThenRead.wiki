= Introduction =

The problem is that we want to get write data and write it before we read.
    1. But when the machine is empty we do not get data from the WriteBack.
    2. When the machine stalls we still need to write the data in.

We need to make sure that if there was supposed to be a returning writeback the write happens before the read.

We can simply count how many data sets were sent down the pipe versus how many write back happened. If there were > 3 sent vs write back we need to wait for writeback.
