#summary How lw (loading from memory into register) is working

= Introduction =

lw $s1 10($s0)
add $s2 $s1 $s3

There are 2 cycles to stall (assuming the RF is write then read).
Using similar approach to RAW the Exe can compare to previous cycles to see the lw happened on a relevant register. When this happens we need to wait in the Exe until the relevant result is provided from the WriteBack.

Since we may get two successive lw we will enhance the WriteReg with an extra bit modulo 2.
When we receive the result from the WriteBack it will include that bit to compare with.

Need to make sure we can track matching on both lines !
So need to track received data of each of them.
